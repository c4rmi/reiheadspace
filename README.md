# reiheadspace
This is my first ever website, created using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. This is a requirement for our first midterm examination in our Introduction to Computing course, for the 1st year, 1st term of my college at the National University of the Philippines, Manila Campus under the BSCS with a specialization in Machine Learning course. 

The website's theme is inspired by OMORI, a well-known RPG, pixel game by Omocat. Instead of using the word 'whitespace', I used headspace instead. 

This website includes some information about me, my creative, and literary works, and my social links. 

I only had two days to do this website. I was so glad it turned out great.
